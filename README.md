The following code is a Python program that allows a user to enter a query and receive a response. The response is generated by searching for a relevant Wikipedia article 
based on the user's input and summarizing the article. The program also identifies and replaces synonyms in the user's input before searching Wikipedia. The following
code uses libraries like: os, warnings, nltk, openfabric-pysdk, and wikipedia.

There are four functions that are used, namely: 
1. process_input: To process the user's input by summarizing relevant wikipedia's page based on the search.
2. replace_synonyms: To replace the synonyms occuring in user input with the common ones so that It is easier to generate response.
3. config: To setup the wikipedia API and suppress warnings.
4. execute: To generate response for the user's query.

Try blocks are used within the functions in order to catch errors. The following code is carried out after doing testing such that the code is less glitchy.
